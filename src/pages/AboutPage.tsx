            <p>
              Traditional Ayurvedic consultations are powerful but often inaccessible. ArogyPath bridges this gap by using a detailed, multi-point assessment to determine your unique Dosha (Prakriti) and current imbalances (Vikriti). Our plans are never one-size-fits-all.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use a sophisticated engine to instantly process your body type, digestion, energy levels, and stress profile, creating an immediate, actionable guide to align your diet and lifestyle with your inner constitution.
            </p>
            <h2 className="section-title mt-4">The Power of Technology</h2>
            <p>
              Our platform is built on cutting-edge AI and data analysis, meticulously trained by certified Ayurvedic experts. This ensures the accuracy and authenticity of every recommendation, giving you a reliable partner on your journey to lasting well-being.
